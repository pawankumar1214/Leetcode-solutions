# Verifying an Alien Dictionary

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- order.length == 26
- All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

                return False
            for s1, s2 in zip(a, b):
                if ind[s1] < ind[s2]:
                    break
                elif ind[s1] > ind[s2]:
                    return False
        return True
```
